Improving documentation is a valuable way to contribute! By contributing to the documentation, you‚Äôll help improve the project‚Äôs accessibility and usability for all users! Here‚Äôs how you can help:

- **Check for duplicates** : Review the [open](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/bootstrap-coded-templates/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and [closed](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/bootstrap-coded-templates/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issue tickets, as well as the üí° [Ideas + Community Vote!](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/bootstrap-coded-templates/discussions/categories/ideas-community-vote) and üí¨ [Q & A](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/bootstrap-coded-templates/discussions/categories/q-a) sections in the discussions tab, to ensure the suggestion or correction hasn‚Äôt already been submitted.
- **Submit your documentation changes** : You can propose your documentation updates in two ways:
  - Post in üí° [Ideas + Community Vote!](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/bootstrap-coded-templates/discussions/new?category=ideas-community-vote) : Share your ideas or corrections in the discussions tab to gather feedback and suggestions from others. OR,
  - Submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/bootstrap-coded-templates/compare) : Make the necessary changes directly to the code. Here's the requirements:
    - Prepare your workspace:
      - **[Fork the repository](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/bootstrap-coded-templates/fork)** : Create a copy of the repo under your account.
      - **Clone the repo locally** : Work on the code on your local machine.
    - Create a new branch. Use the following naming convention for your branch:
      
      `docs-GitHubUserName-shortdescription`
      
      Examples:
      - `docs-thenocturnaldevgypsy-addedinstallationguidelines`
      - `docs-thenocturnaldevgypsy-updatedmdfilesformat`

    - Submit your pull request (PR):
      - Your PR should be linked to your branch
      - Add the `docs` label to your PR for backtracking purposes.

      - Assign the author ([Abegail Torrendon / thenocturnaldevgypsy](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy-io)) or maintainers to review your PR.
  
- **Review process** :
  - The author and maintainers will review all suggestions and make the necessary adjustments based on their judgment.
  - Unlike feature requests, documentation updates will not be subject to community voting. Decisions will rely solely on the maintainers‚Äô perspective.
  - The original requestor will be credited by tagging them in both the issue and the related pull request. They will also be notified once the feature has been implemented and merged.

    - Visual aids (optional) : Share mockups, flowcharts, or any other material to help visualize your idea.
  - **Community prioritization** : Features will be prioritized based on community feedback. Ideas with at least 10 "Yes/I support" votes will be considered for implementation.
